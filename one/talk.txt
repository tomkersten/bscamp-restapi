# Note: Not really "rest"...but...rest-ish
## not using "controls" (such as forms, no standards for links, etc)
## those things can be spec'd out...but...we didn't...so it's not "rest"

# API versioning
## high-level (url-based, mime-type based, fuggit...we're agile)
## vendor-specific mime-types (accept header)
### wat? y?
## How'd we do it?
### show code for registrar
### show deprecation/unsupported handling
### show how layouts tie in (and json_vX, etc)

# Misc (tools, tips, etc)
## documentation links in your response bodies
### is cucumber good for API integration testing?
#### looks interesting & feels nice, but not tested with
     true "external devs"
### also, people are starting to promote using 'rel'
## When using JSON, consider using objects unless you *know*
   the value won't change. evah.
