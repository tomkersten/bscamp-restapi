# Some thoughts on RESTful(-ish) APIs

This is a presentation I gave at #bscamp in Chicago on February 12, 2012
It outlines a few observations from a recent project.

The slides may be of little use outside the context of the talk, but,
check it out if you are interested...


I used the showoff gem to create the presentation. To view locally:
